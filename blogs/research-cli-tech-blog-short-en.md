research search "deep learning in medical diagnosis" --db arxiv,pubmed,ieee --ai-rank
```

**Key Features:**
- **Parallel multi-database search**: Simultaneously searches arXiv, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar
- **AI semantic understanding**: Transformer-based semantic matching, not just keywords
- **Smart deduplication**: 98% accuracy based on title, author, and DOI
- **Relevance scoring**: ML models prioritize most relevant content

### 2. 📝 AI Writing Assistant

Academic writing support from conception to completion:

```bash
# Generate structured outline
research outline "AI Safety in Autonomous Vehicles" --type experimental

# Improve writing style
research write improve draft.tex --style apa --check grammar
```

**Features:**
- **Intelligent outline generation**: AI creates structured outlines based on topic and paper type
- **Language optimization**: Grammar checking (95% accuracy), style consistency, readability enhancement
- **Citation management**: Automated formatting for multiple citation styles

### 3. 📚 Smart Literature Management

One-stop literature management solution:

```bash
# Import PDFs with metadata extraction
research bib import papers/*.pdf --extract-metadata

# Citation network analysis
research analyze citations --input library.bib --output network.html
```

**Capabilities:**
- **Smart PDF parsing**: Automatic extraction of titles, authors, abstracts
- **Format conversion**: Support for BibTeX, EndNote, RIS formats
- **Citation network visualization**: Interactive graphs showing research trends and core literature

### 4. 📊 Data Analysis Tools
