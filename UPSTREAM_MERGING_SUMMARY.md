# Research CLI - Upstream Merging Strategy Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive upstream merging strategy developed for safely incorporating Gemini CLI updates into the Research CLI project. The strategy includes automated scripts, monitoring tools, and detailed documentation to ensure reliable and maintainable merging.

## Problem Statement

Research CLI is a fork of Google's Gemini CLI with extensive customizations. The challenge is to:
- Safely merge upstream improvements while preserving Research CLI's unique features
- Automatically handle branding changes (Gemini → Research)
- Maintain code quality and functionality
- Provide rollback capabilities
- Enable regular monitoring of upstream updates
- **Fork Point Management**: Use 2025-07-13 commit as the starting point for upstream merges

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Automated Scripts

#### Core Merge Scripts
- **`scripts/merge-upstream.sh`** - Main orchestration script
- **`scripts/merge-upstream-batch.sh`** - Batch cherry-picking by priority
- **`scripts/replace-gemini-branding.sh`** - Automated branding replacement
- **`scripts/monitor-upstream.js`** - Upstream monitoring and recommendations

#### Helper Scripts
- **`scripts/merge-package-json.js`** - Intelligent package.json conflict resolution
- **`scripts/merge-readme.js`** - README conflict resolution (if needed)
- **`scripts/upstream-config.js`** - Centralized configuration management
- **`scripts/test-upstream-config.js`** - Configuration testing and validation

### 2. Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Regular Monitoring
- Automated upstream update detection
- Commit categorization by priority
- Merge readiness checks
- Recommendations for action

#### Conflict Resolution
- Automatic branding replacement
- Intelligent package.json merging
- Manual resolution guidance
- Backup and rollback procedures

## Key Features

### 1. Priority-Based Merging

Commits are merged in priority order:
1. **Critical fixes** (highest priority)
2. **Security updates**
3. **Refactoring and improvements**
4. **New features**
5. **Testing updates**
6. **Build and CI/CD updates**
7. **Dependency updates**
8. **Documentation updates**
9. **Other updates**

### 2. Automated Branding Replacement

Comprehensive replacement of Gemini branding with Research branding:
- Package names: `@google/gemini-cli` → `@iechor/research-cli`
- Repository URLs
- Command names: `gemini` → `research`
- Environment variables
- Documentation references
- Configuration files

### 3. Intelligent Conflict Resolution

- **Branding conflicts**: Automatically resolved
- **Package.json conflicts**: Preserve Research CLI specific fields
- **Configuration conflicts**: Manual resolution with guidance
- **Feature conflicts**: Manual resolution with documentation

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

- Unit tests after each batch
- Build verification
- Integration tests
- Cross-platform testing
- Manual testing checklist

### 5. Backup and Rollback

- Automatic backup creation before merging
- Quick rollback procedures
- Selective rollback options
- Backup preservation until confidence

### 6. Fork Point Management

- Fixed fork point: 2025-07-13 commit (`26a79fec`)
- Centralized configuration management
- Easy fork point updates when needed
- Configuration validation and testing

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Monitor Upstream Updates

```bash
# Check for available updates
node scripts/monitor-upstream.js

# Check merge readiness only
node scripts/monitor-upstream.js --check-only
```

### 2. Execute Merge Process

```bash
# Run complete merge process
./scripts/merge-upstream.sh

# Run individual components
./scripts/replace-gemini-branding.sh
./scripts/merge-upstream-batch.sh
```

### 3. Handle Conflicts

```bash
# Resolve package.json conflicts
node scripts/merge-package-json.js --all

# Apply branding replacement
./scripts/replace-gemini-branding.sh
```

### 4. Rollback if Needed

```bash
# Quick rollback
./scripts/merge-upstream.sh --rollback

# Manual rollback
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup-before-upstream-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```
