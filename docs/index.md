# Welcome to Research CLI documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and developing Research CLI. This tool lets you interact with Research models through a command-line interface and includes powerful academic research capabilities.

## Overview

Research CLI brings the capabilities of Research models to your terminal in an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. Research CLI consists of a client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server (`packages/core`), which in turn manages requests to the Research API and its AI models. 

**New in this version:** Research CLI now includes a comprehensive suite of academic research tools for literature search, paper writing, data analysis, and journal submission - making it a complete research workflow platform.

## ðŸŽ“ Research Features

- **[Research Tools](./tools/research-tools.md):** Complete academic research workflow from literature search to paper submission
- **Paper Writing:** Outline generation, writing assistance, and LaTeX management
- **Bibliography Management:** Multi-database search with BibTeX support
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization
- **Submission Tools:** Journal matching and submission preparation

## Quick Start for Researchers

```bash
# Install Research CLI
npm install -g @iechor/research-cli

# Start the CLI
research

# Search for papers
/research search "machine learning" --source=arxiv --limit=10

# Generate paper outline
/paper outline "AI in Healthcare" --type=research --format=ieee

# Analyze your draft
/research analyze draft.tex --type=all

# Find suitable journals
/submit journal --topic "artificial intelligence"

# Prepare submission
/submit prepare --project ./my-paper --journal "Nature"
```

## Getting Started

For first-time users, we recommend starting with the [CLI Introduction](./cli/index.md) to understand the basic concepts and commands. Researchers should also explore the [Research Tools](./tools/research-tools.md) documentation to understand the full academic workflow capabilities.
